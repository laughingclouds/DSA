# Cp-Tricks-and-techniques
This repo is to serve as a reference and to record all the cp tricks and techniques in cp that I've ever learnt

Hope this helps anyone that has a similar path to mine
You are free to fork these and make your own additions, do keep in mind that I chose a rather greedy license.
In short, if you fork the stuff I put in here and make additions...I should be able to see them.

That way, anything new that you learn, will be something new that I might think about learning.
